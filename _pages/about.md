# About Me

Hi, I’m **Mark Agban**, an Aerospace Engineering graduate student at UCLA and currently a Subsystem Design Engineer at Lockheed Martin.  

I’ve worked on projects ranging from aircraft harness design and bracket installation to accessibility engineering at UCLA, and I’m passionate about aerospace, manufacturing, and hands-on design.  

This site is a growing portfolio of my engineering work, including:  
- **Custom Go-Kart Build** (design + fabrication in progress)  
- **Bruin Racing strain gauge system**  
- **Haas Automation HID-controlled access system**  
- **Accessibility engineering for UCLA’s Disabilities & Computing Program**
