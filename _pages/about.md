Hi, I’m **Mark Agban** — an **Aerospace Engineering B.S. (UCLA)** focused on **design, manufacturing, and hands-on builds**.

I like turning ideas into working hardware. Recent work includes a **custom go-kart build** (engine trade study, SolidWorks chassis weldments, cut-list optimization) and **accessibility engineering** that makes technical documents usable for everyone.

### What I’m working on
- **Custom Go-Kart Build** — SolidWorks weldments (1"×1" A513), torque-converter drivetrain, fabrication plan & cut list.  
- **Accessibility Engineering (UCLA DCP)** — PDF remediation workflows, alt-text standards, and QA.  
- **Shop & controls projects** — HID-controlled access for machines (scanner + solenoid lock), fixtures, and small fab work.

### Skills
- **CAD & Analysis:** SolidWorks (weldments, drawings), basic FEA, Ansys (intro CFD), MATLAB  
- **Manufacturing:** Mills, drill press, bandsaw/cut-off saw, basic welding/fixturing, 3D printing  
- **Electronics & Controls:** Arduino basics, wiring, relays/solenoids, SD logging  
- **Documentation:** BOMs, build logs, process instructions, accessibility remediation

### Education
- **B.S., Aerospace Engineering — UCLA**
