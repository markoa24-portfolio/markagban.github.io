I’m **Mark Agban** — **B.S. Aerospace Engineering (UCLA)** — focused on mechanical design and manufacturing. I like taking ideas from **CAD → cuts → welds**, with a bias toward **DFM**, clean packaging, and clear build docs.

**Current focus — Custom Go-Kart (live axle):** single-seat platform for reliability and easy service. **212 cc electric-start** four-stroke → **30-series TAV** → **1″ live axle** on a **square-tube weldment** chassis. CAD-driven layout for ergonomics and chain/brake/steering clearances. Built in-house to control cost and learning, with a **custom push-to-start** (integrated to the ES circuit) and a coil **kill-switch**.

### Skills (core)
- **Mechanical Design & CAD:** SolidWorks (weldments, advanced assemblies, drawings), GD&T basics, tolerance stack-ups  
- **Analysis & CAE:** Hand calcs (structures/mechanics), basic FEA, MATLAB; early-stage performance & packaging tradeoffs  
- **DFM & Manufacturing Planning:** Process planning, kerf/tolerance-aware cut lists, jig/fixture strategy, weld sequencing, inspection approach  
- **Systems Integration:** Drivetrain alignment & chainline, steering/brake geometry, electrical integration (ES push-to-start, kill-switch, fusing, harness routing)  
- **Documentation & Ops:** BOMs & revision control, build instructions, checklists, accessibility remediation workflows

**Highlights:** Haas (shop/fixtures & HID access), Lamsco West (manufacturing engineering), **GHPR**, **SHINE**, and accessibility engineering at UCLA DCP.
