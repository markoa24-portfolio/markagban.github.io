Hi, I’m **Mark Agban** — an **Aerospace Engineering B.S. (UCLA)** focused on **design, manufacturing, and hands-on builds**.

I enjoy turning models into parts and parts into working systems. Recent work includes a **custom go-kart** (SolidWorks weldments, cut-list optimization, drivetrain/packaging, and a practical fab plan) and **accessibility engineering** that makes complex technical documents usable for everyone.

**Currently working on**
- **Custom Go-Kart Build** — 1"×1"×.120" A513 chassis, torque-converter drive, axle/brake/chain layout, optimized cut plan, jig & weld sequence.
- **Accessibility Engineering (UCLA DCP)** — PDF remediation at scale, alt-text standards, QA workflows and training.
- **Shop & controls projects** — HID-controlled access with relay/solenoid, small fixtures, and fabrication tooling.

**Skills**
- **CAD & Analysis:** SolidWorks (weldments, drawings), basic FEA, Ansys (intro CFD), MATLAB  
- **Manufacturing:** Milling, drilling, bandsaw/cut-off saw, basic welding & fixturing, 3D printing  
- **Electronics/Controls:** Arduino basics, relays/solenoids, wiring, SD logging  
- **Documentation:** BOMs, build logs, process instructions, accessibility remediation

**Education**  
- **B.S., Aerospace Engineering — UCLA**
