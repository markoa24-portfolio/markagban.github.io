Welcome — I’m **Mark Agban**, an aerospace engineer (B.S., UCLA) who likes taking ideas all the way from CAD to chips and real hardware. This site collects the projects where I learned the most about **design-for-manufacture, shop processes, and clear documentation**.

### Featured project: Custom Go-Kart Build (in progress)
- **Chassis:** SolidWorks **weldment** frame in 1"×1"×.120" A513 square tubing. No compound miters; parametric cut-list with **optimized cut order** to reduce waste.  
- **Packaging/layout:** Engine plate, **torque converter** drive, rear **live axle**, rotor/caliper, seat, pedals, and steering—checked **axle and chain clearance** and service access.  
- **Manufacturing plan:** Abrasive cut-off workflow (Hercules 14"), deburr approach, **angle marking**/verification method, tack-sequence and basic jig strategy for squareness.  
- **BOM & docs:** Materials list, hardware, and tooling; step-by-step fab plan to move from model → cuts → welds → assembly.  
- **Electrical safety:** Simple **kill-switch** for the ignition circuit and inline-fuse rationale for protection.

See **[Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/)** for the running build log, and **[CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/)** or **[Contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)** to reach me.
