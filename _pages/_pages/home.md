I’m **Mark Agban**, an aerospace engineer (B.S., UCLA) who likes taking ideas from **CAD → cuts → welds** into working hardware. I focus on design-for-manufacture, practical packaging, and writing clear build docs.

### Featured project: Custom Go-Kart (live-axle)
A single-seat platform built for reliability and easy service. **212 cc electric-start** four-stroke → **30-series TAV** → **1" live axle**. **Square-tube weldment** chassis with geometry and packaging verified in CAD. Built **in-house** with simple shop tooling to meet budget, and finished with a **custom push-to-start** (ES circuit) plus a coil **kill-switch**.

See **[Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/)** for the full write-up.
