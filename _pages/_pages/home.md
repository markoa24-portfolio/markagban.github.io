I’m **Mark Agban**, an aerospace engineer (B.S., UCLA) who likes taking ideas all the way from **CAD → cuts → welds** into working hardware. This site focuses on design-for-manufacture, shop process, and clear documentation.

### Featured project: Custom Go-Kart (live-axle, in progress)
- **Platform:** 1"×1"×.120" A513 **square-tube weldment**, **live rear axle**, 212 cc ES engine, **30-series TAV**.  
- **Why this design:** simple fixturing, robust packaging, reliable starting, and parts you can source and service.  
- **Build approach:** **in-house** with a 14" abrasive chop saw + angle grinder; cut-list/kerf accounted; balanced tack sequence.  
- **Controls:** custom **push-to-start** on the ES path (fused + relay), plus a coil **kill-switch**.
