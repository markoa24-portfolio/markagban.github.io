Welcome — I’m **Mark Agban**, an aerospace engineer (B.S., UCLA) who likes taking ideas all the way from **CAD → cuts → welds → working hardware**. This site focuses on the projects where I’ve learned the most about **design-for-manufacture, shop process, and clear documentation**.

### Featured project: Custom Go-Kart Build (in progress)
- **Chassis:** SolidWorks **weldment** frame in 1"×1"×.120" A513 square tubing. Parametric members with an **optimized cut-order** (kerf accounted) to minimize waste.  
- **Packaging & geometry:** Engine plate, **30-series torque converter**, live rear axle, rotor/caliper, seat, pedals, and steering. Verified **axle/chain clearance** and service access; revised hanger mounting height for a level stance.  
- **Steering & ergonomics:** Dedicated **steering crossbar** aligned to spindles, shaft with bearings, and adult reach/legroom checked.  
- **Manufacturing plan:** Abrasive cut-off workflow, deburr/label, angle-marking & verification, **balanced tack sequence** and simple jig strategy to hold squareness.  
- **Electrical & safety:** **Lifan 212 ES** push-to-start integration (proper fuse sizing and relay path), plus an ignition **kill-switch**.
