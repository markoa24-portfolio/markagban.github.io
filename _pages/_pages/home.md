I’m **Mark Agban** (B.S. Aerospace, UCLA). I like taking ideas from **CAD → cuts → welds** into working hardware, with an emphasis on design-for-manufacture and clear documentation.

### Featured project: Custom Go-Kart (live-axle)
A single-seat platform built for reliability and easy service: **212 cc electric-start** four-stroke → **30-series TAV** → **1″ live axle**, on a **square-tube weldment** chassis. The project is intentionally **built in-house** to meet budget and learning goals, and features a **custom push-to-start** (ES circuit) plus a coil **kill-switch**.

See **[Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/)** for the full write-up.
