## Experience

### UCLA Disabilities & Computing Program — Lead Accessibility Engineer
- Built scalable PDF remediation workflows (headings, reading order, alt text), increasing pass rates and reducing revision cycles.
- Authored reusable, step-by-step guides; standardized tagging for complex science/engineering slides; trained campus partners.

### Haas Automation — Mechanical/Shop Engineering Intern
- Designed and installed an **HID card–controlled machine access** system (reader → relay → solenoid) to secure high-value equipment.
- Modeled and fabricated brackets/fixtures; documented wiring and operator procedures for sustainment.

### Lamsco West — Manufacturing Engineering Intern
- Performed spec-based quality checks, reviewed drawings/manufacturing plans, and supported nonconformance resolution with production/quality.
- Recommended cutting/fixturing/routing adjustments for small titanium/precision parts to mitigate damage and rework risk.

## Projects

### Custom Go-Kart (live axle, in progress)
- **Platform:** 212 cc electric-start four-stroke → 30-series TAV → 1″ live axle; **square-tube weldment** chassis (1″×1″×.120″ A513).  
- **Process:** CAD-driven packaging (axle/chain/brake/seat/steering), optimized cut order (kerf managed), in-house fabrication.  
- **Controls:** **Custom push-to-start** integrated with the ES circuit; coil **kill-switch**.
