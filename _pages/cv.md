## Projects

### Custom Go-Kart (live axle, in progress)
**Platform:** 212 cc **electric-start** four-stroke → **30-series TAV** → **1″ live axle**; **square-tube weldment** chassis (1″×1″×.120″ A513).  
**Design & DFM:** CAD-driven packaging for chain/brake/steering and ergonomics; **kerf-aware cut-list** & optimized cut order; jig/fixture strategy and balanced tack sequence for squareness.  
**Integration:** **Custom push-to-start** integrated with the ES circuit; **coil kill-switch** and fusing; serviceable layout and cable routing.  
**Why:** Built **in-house** to control cost and accelerate learning—from CAD → cuts → welds → assembly and test.

## Experience

### Haas Automation — Mechanical/Shop Engineering Intern
- Designed and installed an **HID card–controlled access** system (reader → controller → relay → solenoid) to secure high-value machines.  
- Modeled and fabricated brackets/fixtures; routed and labeled wiring; produced operator and sustainment documentation.  
- Supported shop projects and quick-turn fixtures; collaborated with techs to validate fit/function on the floor.

### Lamsco West — Manufacturing Engineering Intern
- Performed **spec-driven** quality checks, reviewed drawings/manufacturing plans, and assisted nonconformance resolution.  
- Recommended cutting/fixturing/routing changes for small precision parts to reduce scrap risk and rework.  
- Contributed to documentation updates to align processes with aerospace requirements.

### GHPR — **<YOUR ROLE / PROGRAM>**
- **<WHAT YOU BUILT / ANALYZED>**, using **<tools / methods>**, leading to **<impact/result with numbers if possible>**.  
- **<Ownership or leadership>**: **<designed/implemented/validated X>**; coordinated with **<team/partners>**; delivered **<artifact/report/demo>**.  
- **<Any testing, data, or outcome>**: **<metrics, reliability, speed, accuracy, cost saved, etc.>**.

### SHINE — **<YOUR ROLE / PROGRAM>**
- **<Project focus>**: **<designed/built/tested>** **<system/component>**; **<method/experiment>**; **<result/insight>**.  
- Documented process and findings; presented to **<audience>**; incorporated feedback into **<rev/iteration>**.  
- **<Tools/skills>**: **<CAD/analysis/coding/lab techniques>** used to achieve **<measurable outcome>**.

### UCLA Disabilities & Computing Program — Lead Accessibility Engineer
- Built scalable **PDF remediation** workflows (headings, reading order, alt text) that improved pass rates and reduced rework cycles.  
- Authored reusable, step-by-step guides and **standards** for complex science/engineering slides; trained campus partners.  
- Performed QA and provided targeted feedback to raise consistency across contributions.
