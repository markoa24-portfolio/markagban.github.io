## Experience

### UCLA Disabilities & Computing Program — Lead Accessibility Engineer
- Built scalable PDF remediation workflows (headings, reading order, alt text), improving pass rates and review speed for campus content.
- Authored clear, step-by-step guides and trained partners; reduced rework by standardizing tagging patterns for complex science slides.

### Haas Automation — Mechanical/Shop Engineering Intern
- Designed and implemented an **HID card–controlled machine access** system (scanner → relay → solenoid lock) to secure high-value equipment.
- Modeled, fabricated, and installed brackets/fixtures; documented wiring and procedures to hand off for sustainment.

### Lamsco West — Manufacturing Engineering Intern
- Performed quality checks to aerospace specs, reviewed drawings/manufacturing plans, and supported nonconformance resolution with production/quality.
- Proposed practical process changes (cutting/fixturing/routing) for small precision parts to reduce scrap risk and downstream rework.

## Selected Projects
### Custom Go-Kart (live axle, in progress)
- 1"×1"×.120" A513 square-tube **weldment** chassis, **212 cc electric-start** engine, **30-series TAV**, #420 chain.
- CAD-driven packaging (axle/chain/brake/seat/steering), optimized cut order, in-house fabrication, **custom push-to-start** on ES circuit.

### HID-Controlled Machine Access
- Arduino + HID reader + relay + solenoid; simple access-logging plan with SD; enclosure, cable routing, and documentation for operators.
