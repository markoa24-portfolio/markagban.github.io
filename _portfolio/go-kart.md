## Custom Go-Kart Build

**Context:**  
Designed and built a gasoline-powered go-kart from scratch with my brother under a $2,000 budget. Goal was to create a single-seater kart using a torque converter system.

**My Role:**  
- Led engine selection (trade study: Predator 212 vs Tillotson vs Lifan).  
- Designed chassis using SolidWorks Weldments with 1"x1" A513 square tubing.  
- Performed cut list optimization and planned fabrication steps.  
- Selected materials and verified axle clearance with the engine plate.  

**Process:**  
- CAD modeling and chassis structural planning.  
- Evaluated torque converter vs gearbox.  
- Planned welding and fabrication workflow.  

**Outcome (In Progress):**  
- CAD model finalized and validated.  
- Material list created and tubing length calculated.  
- Ready for fabrication (cutting + welding next).

**Reflection:**  
This project taught me about design-for-manufacturing, budget-driven engineering, and efficient use of materials. It also gave hands-on experience in CAD, trade studies, and planning fabrication for real-world builds.
