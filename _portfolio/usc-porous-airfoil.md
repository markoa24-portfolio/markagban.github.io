## Overview
Summer research at **USC Viterbi** (SHINE program): investigated how **porous holes** in a **NACA 0012** airfoil influence lift/drag by affecting separation. We varied **hole spacing** (10%, 15%, 20% of chord) and **hole angle** (tested at 3°, 6°, 9°, 12° AoA references) and matched prior work at **Re ≈ 5×10⁴**.

## Methods
- **CAD & Fabrication:** Created multiple porous configurations in **SolidWorks**, split models for 3D printing, cleaned/finished surfaces, and assembled for testing.  
- **Simulation:** Built a **2D cross-section** workflow in **ANSYS** (MATLAB/Excel helpers) with named selections, meshing near wall regions, and transient runs for configuration comparisons.  
- **Experiment:** Ran **water-channel** tests with laser sheet + high-speed camera to visualize flow and compare velocity contours.

## My role
- Drove the CAD + print pipeline and dimensional consistency across porous patterns.  
- Set up the sim geometry/mesh/transient run to compare spacing/angle combinations at the target Reynolds number.  
- Assisted with water-channel prep/operation and compiled figures/contours into the final poster.
